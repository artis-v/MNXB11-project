# Workplan

## Idea

To get three results from the temperature data about:
* Get how many days the temperature was in a given range each year (as a histogram)
* Get how many consecutive days the temperature was in a given range each year (as a histogram)
* Get how many consecutive days the temperature was in a given amplitude each year (as a histogram)

## Parts

### Data preparation

Sebastian will extract the datasets, choose which one to use and remove unnecessary rows with BASH.

### Data extraction and analysis

Artis will use C++ to generate the results.

### Create figures

Sebastian will use ROOT to create the histograms.
